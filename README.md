## Introduction
Due to the increased price of new cars and the incapability of customers to buy new cars due to the lack of funds, used cars sales are on a global increase.
There is a need for a used car price prediction system to effectively determine the worthiness of the car using a variety of features.

## Methodology
- Visual Studio Code for GUI and Jupiter Notebook for Machine Learning Model
- Tkinter Python library to make it interactive and user friendly
- Load data into MySQL for storage
- IBM Watson Language Translator API

## Overview
- Used `Random Forest Regressor`, `98%` Accuracy on Training Set and `95%` Accuracy on Test Set
- Exploratory data analysis with Pandas, Mathplotlib & Seaborn to explore the insights

## Quick Demo
